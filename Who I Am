In addition to my background in IT infrastructure and network engineering, I have been leading the development of VirFlow, a large-scale SaaS platform built with FastAPI, React, and Tailwind. The project integrates async operations, database pooling, and structured logging to support thousands of concurrent users. While it is not in C++, it demonstrates my ability to design and implement high-performance, scalable systemsâ€”experience that I believe translates well into finance technology roles such as OEMS/PMS development.
